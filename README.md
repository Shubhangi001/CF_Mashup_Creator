# CF_Mashup_Creator
Welcome to the Codeforces Mashup Assistant Bot! This bot is designed to assist you in creating custom coding challenges by combining problem sets from the popular competitive programming platform, Codeforces. The bot takes in the Codeforces handles of the users and their ratings of problems and gives you a set of unsolved problems by the given users. With this bot, you can easily identify the gaps in your problem-solving skills and focus on problem sets that you haven't solved yet. It will help you to pick the right set of problems for your practice and training. Whether you're looking to improve your skills, preparing for a competition, or just looking for a new challenge, this bot will assist you in every step of the way. Let's get started and create your own Codeforces Mashup!
